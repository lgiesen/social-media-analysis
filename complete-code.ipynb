    "## Summarized Results\n",
    "- The network is globally sparse, with low average clustering, meaning most users are not well-connected to their neighbors.\n",
    "- Within this sparse structure, some communities form tightly-knit clusters, which the Louvain algorithm identifies.\n",
    "- Central users, such as `1010626427`, act as bridges connecting these otherwise independent communities, creating a sparse but connected global network.\n",
    "- User activity distribution is highly skewed, with a few users contributing disproportionately to the total activity."
